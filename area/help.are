56 ''IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

62 AASIGN~
~

53 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

-1 AD ADS ADVERTISING~
&w
It is against the rules of this mud to advertise another mud either on
public channels (say, chat, ask, answer, shout, yell, music, quest, avatar,
newbiechat, any guild, order, clan or council channel, wartalk or racetalk),
through your title, description, or biography or via leaving a note on any
public, guild, order, clan or council board here at Njata.  If you are

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

52 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

-1 ADVENTURE~
&w
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

1 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
&w
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~

51 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis

1 AGGRESSIVE 'AGGRESSIVE STYLE'~
&w

52 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.

1 AREAS~
&w
Syntax:  areas
Syntax:  areas old
Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.
 
You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
The Realms of Despair will provide a copy of areas built by individuals
to that individual and no one else. To receive a copy of an area for use
on other muds, you must contact that individual.
 
~

0 ARMOR~
&w
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character
by 20 points.
~

52 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:
 
&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.
 
&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of 
the values returned for Value0 based on level:
 
&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------   
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15
     
&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:
 
&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.

Syntax:  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'farsight'     <victim>
Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>

'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  Type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

2 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>
 
  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

1 AUC AUCTION~
&w
Syntax: auction (abbreviations: a , auc)
Syntax: auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax: auction bid <value>
 
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported to SMAUG from a publicly available source.)
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
SEE also "help AUCTION2" for more on auction commands
&Y* Auctions will not be stopped for overbidding or misbidding*&w
~

1 AUCTION2~
&w
Auction will also work with the following arguments:
 
au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.
Exception: Old clan equipment that was converted to be worn by both peaceful
           and deadly players.
 
Also see: 'HELP AUCTION' for more information.

Syntax: avtalk <message>

This allows you to use the avtalk (level 50+) channel.
~

1 BACKFIRE~
&w
Magical items (pills, potions, staffs, wands) which cast offensive spells
have a chance of backfiring if the character using them is much lower in
level than the spell level on the item.
 
For example, a level 15 character trying to invoke a wand with level 50
fireball may injure themselves when the spell backfires.
 
~

1 BACKSTAB BS~
&w
Syntax:  backstab <victim>
Syntax:  bs       <victim>
 
A backstab is a method of attack, used primarily by thieves but able
to be utilized by others in some circumstances, and which inflicts a
tremendous degree of damage on unsuspecting victims if successful.
 
An appropriate weapon type is required to backstab, and if your victim
is wounded or suspicious it may not be possible to surprise them.  The
most important factor in anyone's ability to backstab is to catch the
victim when they are unaware of your presence.
 
~

64 BAIT~
&w
Syntax: bait <item>
Syntax: bait remove
 
This command allows you to put bait on the hook of a fishing pole.
*Note* You must have the fishing pole in your hand.
To remove the bait or the fish you cought type BAIT REMOVE.

~

51 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.
~

51 'BAN 50'~
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.
 
When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.
 
All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.
 
See also: 'BAN ALLOW' 'BAN NEWBIE' 'BAN DURATION' 
~

51 'BAN DURATION'~
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:
 
Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 50 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 50 for 4th offense.
 
Bans for level 2-50: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.
 
All bans above level 50 should be permanent by their very nature.
 
&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&w

~

51 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

0 BARD~
&w
BARD

Diplomats and entertainers first, combatants second, Bards are those gentle
souls who prefer to avoid conflict whenever possible. If a Bard's hand is
forced in combat it will usually be wielding a light blade or a magical
wand. These persons are highly skilled with both, and are usually trained
in three tongues (including their own). Many know how to read and write,
and most are gifted musically, artistically or theatrically. Some say
that anyone who puts half their wits to it can be a Bard; and in some
ways, this is true. Still, it is highly respectable to become one, and to
be a great Bard one must be very charismatic in all they do.
 
~

58 BARENUM BARESIZE~
Syntax: mset <mob> barenum <number>
mset <mob> baresize <num>

These mob fields control the mobs ability to fight without weapons.
Barenum is the low end of the damage done and baresize is the multiplier.
For example: barenum 10 and baresize 5 would have the effect of allowing
the mob to hit barehanded for 10-50 damage. 
 
* This field also affects experience gained.
Experience is calculated as follows:
^level 3*5 + max_hit +barenum *baresize +damroll * 50
+hitroll *ch -> level *10
~

0 BASH~
&w
Syntax:  bash
 
Bash can only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds
during which you cannot heal, flee or perform other extraneous combat actions
(i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else).  These same
consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.
 
Note that bash has a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher is
not one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
~

1 'BENEDICTION'~

&w
BENN

Hailing from Lavada, these animal-headed-people (as humans call them) worship 
a set of gods foreign to the rest of the world. They are thought to be

~

63 BERSERK~
Syntax:  berserk
 
Going berserk sends your warrior into a frenzied state, increasing its
attacks per round to a maximum of six and your strength by one.  While
you are berserking you cannot flee.
~

1 BERSERK 'BERSERK STYLE'~
&w
Syntax: style berserk
 
This tactic is truly powerful, for it causes the fighter to allow pure
rage to flow through him, at the cost of his own judgement and care for
his or her well-being. While the berserked fighter will strike deeper
into an enemies' flesh, his foes will be able to take advantage and bury
their weapons deeper into the berserker.

60 BESTOW BESTOWMENTS~
Syntax: bestow <victim> command [command] [command] etc

Examples:
 
bestowarea joe bob.are           allows joe to work on bob's proto area
bestowarea joe                   lists all of joe's bestowed areas
bestowarea joe list              ditto
bestowarea joe none              removes all of joe's bestowed areas

~

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~
&w
Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from God.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

0 CAST~
&w
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 CATFOLK~
&w
CATFOLK

Catfolk do not much care for cooler climes, and tend to live in the sultry
deserts of Lavada or the tropical paradises in the central parts of Ajax, 
Colista and Dori. Their sharp senses and keen wisdom grant them a sort of 
mysticism in their dealings with other races.

Catfolk are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard    Chevalier           Druid                 Enchanter  Illusionist 
Lancer             Paladin  Ranger  Rogue         Scholar    Warrior

&w
Syntax: cast 'cause light'    <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause serious'  <victim>
Syntax: cast 'cause critical' <victim>
Syntax: cast harm             <victim>

These spells inflict damage on the victim.  The higher-level spells do
more damage.
~

1 'CAUSTIC FOUNT'~
&w
The second discipline of acid mastery, 'Caustic Fount' causes a
fountain of acid to levitate about the casting Mage's victim, bathing
him in a malodorous and painful concoction.  The combination of magical
and physical attack gives this spell appreciable effect in combat versus
a wide variety of physical types.

~

0 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
&w
CENTAUR

Centaurs are intelligent creatures predisposed towards magic. Native to 
Colista, they live in small pockets in Dori as well. Their large size 
sometimes makes it difficult for humans to regard them with trust instead 
of fear.

Centaurs are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard               Cleric           Elementalist  Enchanter  Illusionist 
Lancer             Paladin  Ranger  Rogue         Scholar    Warrior

1 CHANNELS~
&w
Syntax:  channels
Syntax:  channels +<channel|all>
Syntax:  channels -<channel|all>
 
With no options, CHANNELS show you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.  Using the
'all' option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels.
 
Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are
channels available to those with affiliations of some sort, and also tells.
 
The first channels you will have as a new player are SAY, TELL, and NEWBIE.

 - to use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same room,
   just type SAY <message>.
 - to use tell, the target person may be anywhere within the Realms, just
   type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].
 - newbiechat is seen and used only by level 1 characters, members of the
   Newbie Council, and Immortals.
 
For a more complete explanation of each channel's use and who can
use it, read section 3 of your Adventurer's Guide book.
~

1 'CHARGED BEACON'~
&w
Syntax:  c 'charged beacon' <victim>
 
Charged beacon renders the victim susceptible to electricity attacks.
~

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
&w
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Darkhaven or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

&w
Syntax: chat     <message>

Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.
SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

CHAT, QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all interested 
players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The ASK and ANSWER commands 
both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.
You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

~

58 CHECKVNUM CHECKVNUMS~
Syntax: checkvnums <field> <start vnum> <end vnum>
 
Checkvnums will allow you to view if any areas conflict with a set
of vnums that you need.
Correct FIELD values include Mob, Object, Room, or All (all three fields).

Syntax: chess <begin|cease|status|board|move|join>
 
This lovely command allows you to play games of chess with friends and foes

~

0 CHEVALIER~
&w
CHEVALIER

Warriors who have trained to ride upon mounts while in combat, they are 
held to a high standard of personal moral code which is passed among them 
through training and word of mouth. Chevaliers can handle combat when off 
of their mounts, but since their fighting style integrates the use of a 
mount into most everything they do, it is at a disadvantage. They are 
usually proficient with long blades above other weapons, and do not tend 
to know magic. They are quite skilled in medicine, the care of their 
mounts, and the art of discourse. Like Clerics, Chevaliers tend to travel 
a lot.

Persons of races that are mountable, or usually those that have hooves, 
cannot be chevaliers in the traditional sense, since they lack the ability 
to mount other creatures. However, such creatures usually have the ability 
to develop the skills of a Lancer.

~

0 'CHILL TOUCH'~
&w
Syntax:         c 'chill touch' <victim>

0 CHOP~
&w
Syntax: chop

A skill unique to thieves, and which can only be used while in combat.
It inflicts damage comparable to backstab, and requires the thief to
be wielding a piercing weapon.  To sucessfully circle you must be the
first to attack in the battle, or be grouped with whoever was.
 
~

0 CLANS~
&w
Syntax:  clans
    or:  clans <clan name>
 
The 'clans' displays a list of all current clans, the clan deity and its
leader, as well as the clan pkills (victories) and pdeaths (losses).
 
You can also use 'clans <clan name>' to view information on the specified
Clan.

1 CLAW~
&w
Syntax: claw
 
Claw is an ability available to certain races which can only be used once
combat has begun. It inflicts damage on the victim relative to the
character's own level if it lands successfully.
 
~

0 CLERIC CLERICS~
&w
CLERIC

Clerics may be sworn to any patron deity, depending on their place of
origin and racial culture, and so they can be varied in the kinds of
weapons they are trained to use, kinds of magic they choose to practice,
and skills they consider essential. Many use heavy melee weapons, but
this is by no means the norm everywhere. They do all know magic, though
that magic again depends on the deity in particular to whom the Cleric
answers. Skills are somewhat less varied; all Clerics are, as a rule,
trained in the art of writing in their native tongue. Many are also given
rudimentary education in a second, common  language to their region.
Clerics tend to be skilled at cooking and hunting out of necessity, as
most travel extensively to carry out their missions for the deities they
serve. Most tend to wear heavier armor, but some Clerics favor speed over
protection, and fight with a more evasive style.
 
~

51 CLIMATE~
Syntax climate <field> <name>
 
This command allows you to view or modify the climate
settings for an area. There are settings for temperature,
precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current

from. Each field has a different range of values available.
 
Field name:           Values:
temp                  cold, cool, normal, warm, hot
precip                arid, dry, normal, damp, wet
wind                  still, calm, normal, breezy, windy
neighbor              <area name>
 
Specifying an area name with neighbor which is already on
the list will remove it. Using climate without any arguments
will display the area's current setting. Note that this
command always refers to the area which you are currently in.

~

51 COLORS~
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:
 
Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax  &Wfor sytax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Dealies &Wcolored red.
  &YConfig (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.
 
If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.
 
In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~

1 COMBAT~
&w
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.
 
For more information on combat, read section 12 of your Adventurer's Guide.

51 COMMENT~
Syntax: comment write
Syntax: comment subject <subject>
Syntax: comment post <player>
Syntax: comment list <player>
Syntax: comment read <player> #
 
Comment write puts you into a buffer, and the commands work just like writing
a note.  You may only read and post comments on players currently online.
 
Comments should be used for all disciplinary actions and warnings, on anyone
who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.
 
If you have a disciplinary action and the player quits before you are able to
post a comment, please place a copy of the comment on the board located in
hell, room vnum 6.

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
Before asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:&w
 
&r    -&w Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
    -&w Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles,&r and
    -&w Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.&r
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Immortal corpse retrieval.&w

**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Immortal CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  An Immortal may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&gAn Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.&w  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Immortal's decision is final.
~

1 CRASH~
&w
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you. 
 
See &WHELP REIMBURSEMENT &w and &WHELP SAVE &w

0 DAMAGE~
&w
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.

equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)

wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.

1 DEADLYCLANS~
&w
Clans are a society within Realms composed of a group of players which
have joined together under a common cause.  If you a member of a 
clan you have the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your
own clan.  Depending on the clan in which you join, you may be asked 
to follow set of rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 

For more information on a current deadly clan type HELP <clanname>
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however
when the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

1 DEADLYHQ~
&w
Peacefuls are not permitted EVER to enter deadly headquarters.
~

0 DEATH~
&w
When your character dies, you are reincarnated. Your corpse is left behind
where you were killed, together with all of your equipment. Your gold stays
with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time. When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it. Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
For more information on death, see section 13 of your Adventurers Guide.
 
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
&w
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

1 DEFENSIVE 'DEFENSIVE STYLE'~
&w
Syntax: style defensive
 
This style emphasizes the deflecting of blows from an enemy. It is similar
to the evasive style, except that it focuses on holding ground instead of
dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

great detail.  It is here that anyone needing to speak with the Leader of
the Symposium is welcome to relax.  The council's secretary is often seen
here, buried beneath piles of parchments in an unending effort to perform
all of her duties for this very busy group.  The chamberlain, who works
here on a volunteer basis, is often distracted.  Enjoy your visit, and
please feel free to contact any Symposium member for help if the Symposium
head is unavailable.

to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.

1 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
&w
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

1 DISARM~
&w
Syntax:  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.

(1)  you are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals concerning
all issues involved in the game, and
(2)  conversation and situations may arise during the course of play that

~

1 DISCLOSURE~
&w
Syntax c 'disclosure'
 
This spell will reveal any sneaking or hiding players in the area. However,
it will also reveal the caster.
~

1 'DISENCHANT WEAPON'~
&w
Syntax: cast 'disenchant weapon' <weapon>
 
This spell removes a weapon's magical enchantment. The weapon must have an
enchantment upon it to start with, else the disenchantment will not
succeed.

~

1 DISMISS~
&w
Syntax: dismiss <target>

The dismiss command will force your charmed mobile to follow itself and
will negate the charm effect.
 
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
&w
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
&w
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.
 
~

1 DISRUPTION~
&w
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

This command toggles your personal dnd flag.
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level. 
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.
 
When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD 
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To 
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND
 
The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.

0 DOLLFOLK~
&w
DOLLFOLK

A rare race of constructs brought to life (it is commonly thought) through 
the use of magic. Though they do not need to consume sustenance as often 
as other races, they still require it; many of the dollfolk see this as 
reason to believe that their origins may be no more magical than those of 
the naiads or slimes. They have historically served humanity in high society.

Dollfolk are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard    Chevalier  Cleric   Druid   Elementalist  
        Monk       Paladin  Ranger  Rogue         Scholar    Warrior

no bigger than a unicorn or gryphon. Though they have traditionally

know so little about them.

DRUID

Magically linked to the natural world, Druids practice magics that are 
similar to elementalism, but are better versed in the ways of the 
physical world as well. Their magics may be somewhat less impressive, 
but through this hybrid view of a means of living, they are able to 
avoid the same physical frailty that often comes with the intensive 
study of a magic.

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~

If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.

('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.

who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

there are six commonly recognized. These are the elements of water, air, 
fire, earth, life, and darkness. Elementalists are taught directly by 
shamans and mystics who commune with nature spirits, and tend to hold 
animist beliefs, not acknowledging any deity as more than another spirit.

key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.

0 EXITS~
&w
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

51 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
&w
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 50 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 50 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
&w
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

                             www.smaugmuds.org

FUSS stands for: [F]ixed [U]p [S]maug [S]ource
It has also come to be known by the alias: [F]ixed [U]p [S]tock [S]ource

The ongoing goal of this project is to find and eliminate as many of the
bugs in the stock SMAUG source code as possible so as to provide for a
clean, stable base for new admins to run a SMAUG mud from.

The project is coordinated by Samson, lead developer of the AFKMud codebase.
Contributions are made by various members of the SMAUG community.

Most of the fixes are culled from forum posts, emails to the SMAUG mailing
list, and from continuing work on other SMAUG derivative projects in which
bugs are found that apply backward to the base distribution.

~

0 GLORY~
&w
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent"
to improve your items and weapons (among possible other things in the future)
as according to the scale detailed in HELP GLORY RATES.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also recieve lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters.  This would be
like Odysseus passing all the reknown for his deeds off onto someone else.

51 GLORYIMM~
Somethings to keep in mind when giving/taking Glory:
 
  - Glory is UNtradable between mortals.  (Please do not facilitate trades of
         Glory between mortals.
  - It is allowed for a player to use his Glory to affect items for another
         player.
  - Currently, appropriate prizes to be awarded for quests are as follows:
 
  Avatar quests (lvl 40+):
         Suggested Maximum:  50 Glory  (For playing an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For making a notable effort)
    - Then Glory of appropriate amounts (use your judgement) can be given out
         for intermediate efforts between winning and participating.
 
  NOTE:  Being integral doesn't neccessarily mean landing the killing blow on
         the supermob, it might also mean the person who solved the riddle
         leading to the mob (if it was a difficult riddle).
  NOTE:  Prizes should be scaled up or down to reflect the difficulty and
         participation of the quest.  For example a difficult quest would be
         one that takes more than 2 hours to complete.
 
  Non-Avatar quests (lvl < 40):
         Suggested Maximum:  35 Glory  (For an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For a notable effort)
See also: GLORYIMM2, QPSET, GLORY, GLORY RATES.
~

51 GLORYIMM2~
.    Glory does not neccessarily have to be the only prize given out.  In fact
     for the lower level quests it is preferred if a combination of Glory and
     minorly affected/renamed objects are given out as prizes.  i.e. a weapon
     renamed to something related to the quest that has a couple +1's or +2's
     on it (that will be useful for a couple levels, but then discarded).
 
     NOTE:  It is suggested for Guild and Order quests that the prizes be
            scaled down slightly as participation is limited from the entire
            mud - and open exclusively to guild/order members.  The quests they
            recieve from the guild/order are supplemental to the mud-wide ones
            they can participate in.
 
 
     DISCLAIMER:  These numbers are not set in stone, they are guidelines.  The
                  QC is counting on the good judgement of the immortals to
                  make sure the prizes they are giving out are appropriate.
                  The QC reserves the right to change the guidelines as well
                  the right to set them in stone if we find it is being abused.

1 GROUP GROUPING~
&w
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).
 
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
10 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

2 GUILD GUILDS~
&w
Guilds are special organizations for each class within the realms. Belonging
to a Guild has many advantages, such as gaining new knowledge of your class,
making new friends in the Realms, exciting quests, the great feeling of 
helping other players, and many other aspects of Guild life make being in a
Guild a memorable experience.  Each Guild has its own separate headquarter
with a healer, a practice room, a Guild store, and many other rooms that makes
each Guild unique unto itself.
 
Membership in a Guild is not something that is easily obtained, and you must
be a law-abiding player.  Deadly players are not allowed to join Guilds.
There are rules within each Guild, and along with these rules, you must
follow the rules of this MUD.
 
To gain entry into a Guild, you should speak with a leader of the Guild.  The
leaders are those people who have the title <Leader>, <First> and <Second>.
To find out who is on from a Guild, type "who 'Guild of *****'.  For example,
if you are a Druid, and you wish to find out who is on from the Guild of 
Druids, type "who 'Guild of Druids'", and you will be given a list of players
that belong to the Guild.
 
Type &Ghelp guild rules&w for a list of rules about Guild equiment and items.
~

2 'GUILD RULES'~
&w
&RIt is illegal to sell, trade, auction or give away Guild items.&w Including
potions, pills, scrolls, equipment and containers.  Anything you can buy in
a Guild house is off limits for selling.  If you are found to be trading in
these illegal items, you stand the chance of not only being outcast from your
Guild, but your Guild may lose the ability to sell those items.
 
Please do not engage in buying such items either, as the Immortals reserve
the right to remove Guild items from ANY person not belonging to that Guild.
Just because you can buy it on the "black market" does not mean the Immortals
will allow you to keep it.
 
If you are in doubt whether an item is a Guild item, you are free to ask an
Immortal. Most Guild items have the name "guild" on it when you use identify.
 
There are rules that are specific to Guilds.  If you are not sure if something
is legal or illegal within your Guild, please contact a leader.

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
&w
HALF-ELF
 
Half-elves are common in society since humans and elves get along so 
famously. Though they are not technically a race of their own in the 
traditional sense, there is a certain culture that surrounds the idea 
of being a half-elf. Some are third generation, more human now than elf 
or more elf than human, others are direct bastards of an elf and human 
parentage. They are socially frowned upon by some, but others see them 
as the children of the future, capable of great things that unite both 
of the worlds of their origin. 

Half-Elves are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard    Chevalier  Cleric   Druid   Elementalist  Enchanter  Illusionist 
        Monk       Paladin  Ranger  Rogue         Scholar    Warrior

54 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

~

1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
&w
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully hide, creatures cannot see you unless they are affected
by 'detect hidden'.  Player characters can detect you, however.
 
If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.
 
In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.
 
Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level

 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

0 I3~
&w
Syntax: i3 <option>

Note: You must meet the mud's minimum level requirement before accessing I3.
You will be notified when you have reached the approptiate level.

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3 chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3 listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3 chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3 mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3 mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3 ignore <person@mud>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3 invis

i3 chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3 listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3 chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3 mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist smaug&D will list all
  muds who have &Wsmaug&D as part of their listing.

i3 mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3 ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3 invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

0 I3BEEP~
&w
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
&w
Syntax i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3FINGER~
&w
Syntax i3finger <person@mud>

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

When used with the bridge, typing i3finger <mud@i3> will produce a who
listing of the target mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3LOCATE~
&w
Syntax i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
&w
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.

To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3

0 I3WHO~
&w
Syntax i3who <mud>

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

1 ICESHIELD FIRESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
&w
Iceshield conjures an encompassing shield of ice which will return the
attacks of your enemy with tongues of cold.
Syntax:  cast iceshield
 
Fireshield surrounds the caster with a wall of fire which returns your
enemies' attacks with balls of fire.
Syntax:  cast fireshield
 
Shockshield surrounds the caster with a field of electric energy which will
return your enemies' attacks with bolts of lightning.
Syntax:  cast shockshield
 * shockshield cannot be cast on others
 
 
The chances of your shields striking your opponent increase with your level,
with the odds at low levels being very low.
 
Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.

                      you can have one room program check the number of
                      chars in a different room.
                      Note the number of characters is defined as the

Don't confuse this ifcheck with "ovnumwear". It works like so:
 
if ovnumwear(21061) > 3
 
It checks if the mob (the mob associated to the mob prog) has more
than 3 pieces of eq vnum 21061.
 
Ovnumwear only works on the mob associated witht the mob prog.
Wearingvnum checks a specific character - either a PC or NPC.

1 IGNORE~
&w
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in Njata. All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

0 ILLUSIONIST~
&w
ILLUSIONIST

Illusionists are trained in the art of magic which involves a personal
journey to discover what is considered to be the true form of oneself.
These persons are then able to shape the energy of their own perceptions,
enabling them to make their perceptions (over which they have great
control) appear to be real both to themselves and others. Through this
means, an illusionist can sometimes go without real food and water for
quite some time (if necessary, though this is not recommended); they can
appear to be wielding a weapon or spell of greater power than they
actually possess and, through the belief in that power, wound with it.
Illusionists thus fight as though they were not magically trained, but
look very much the part of a Scholar. They tire more easily than other
people because of their constant use of this personal energy to maintain
their illusions.

Associated help files: Bodybag && CR
 
- You are never required to do a CR for a mortal.
- If you do perform an Immortal CR, you are required to take at least one
  item as charge, this item should be one of the best items the player has.
  ** The only exceptions are a CR for a person under level 10 or if you are
  ** running a quest, and the player died in that quest or you have the
  ** approval from a Council of Elders member.  These qualify for a free CR.
- You may never give free CRs to your friends or for your own mortals.
- You may choose more then one item or gold for a CR, but _must_ inform the
  player of your intent prior to bodybagging them.
- You are never allowed to do a cr for a deadly character.
- Corpses should be at least "crawling with vermin" prior to receiving an
  Immortal CR, i.e. a corpse timer of less then 20.

You may never CR for your own mortal unless _all_ the following apply:
   - There is no other Immortal online to do it for you.
   - You have tried to get your corpse on your own, with mortal assistance.
   - Your corpse is in "the last stages of decay", meaning you cannot wait
     any longer, i.e. a corpse timer of less than 8.

If you perform a CR for one of your -own- mortal characters, you must:
   - Take at least one of the better/best items from your mortal, and eat it.
   - Post a note on 1220 stating that you cr'd your own mortal's corpse.
 
***** See 'help timer' to get a list of corpse decay timer and messages.

51 'IMM ECHO'~
Associated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.
 
Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.
 
If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~

51 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~

51 'IMM FORCE'~
Associated help files: force
 
This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.  
 
Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~

51 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
Associated help files: forceclose
 
This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>
 
You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~

51 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze
 
Syntax: deny         <character>
Syntax: disconnect   <character>
Syntax: freeze       <character>
 
DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.  
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
 
DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

51 'IMM GOTO'~
Syntax: goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)
 
~

51 'IMM INVIS'~
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis
 
Those Immortals between levels 51 and 54 may invis to level 51 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in a building projects that
requires you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.
 
Immortals of level 55 and above may use wizinvis beyond 51 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.
~

51 'IMM RECHO'~
Associated help files: recho
 
Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not 
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.
~

51 'IMM SNOOP'~
Associated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.
 
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.
    ** For example, you learn someone is having a mud affair from snoop.
    ** This information has nothing to do with the reason you are snooping
    ** and should not affect your judgement.  It should not be passed on.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.
~

51 IMMAUTH AUTH AUTHORIZE~
Associated help file: Authorize
 
Syntax: authorize <name> <yes|name|no/deny>
 
Authorize is used to allow a new player to start his or her character.
Names must not be offensive or similar to an existing immortal (within a
letter or two).  Names like "Braveheart" are acceptable even though they
are not normally considered "proper" names.  Players are allowed to use
names of mobs ... but not extremely popular mobs.
Use your best judgement when authorizing a name.
 
You may use the abbreviation "a" for authorize and the abbreviation "n" 
for name.  In addition, you only need to type as much of a name to uniquely
identify it.
 
So, for example, if Goixetoika is awaiting authorization,

a                shows pending authorizations
a g              allows the name
a g n            requires player to change name
a g no           denies name and forces player off (offensive name)
~

55 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

51 IMMQUEST~
This help file will contain the current status as well as the expectations of
what is to be followed of Immortals questing.
  Currently imms &YARE&G allowed to quest.
 
&WRules for imm's questing:&G
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to
   quest.  We don't want the situation arising where everyone logs off and the
   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.
 
 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.
 
&WSo when can you quest?&G
 
 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be 
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G
 
 
Immortals can apply once a month for a rename scroll or twenty glory.
Phalanx, on behalf of the Quest Council, and Elcid on behalf of the
Symposium are responsible for the distribution of the monthly 'payments.'
To apply for your monthly rename or share of glory, post a note on 1203
stating the month, the form in which you'd like to receive your payment
(scroll/glory), and the mortal's name that will be receiving the payment.

1 INDIGNATION~
&w
Syntax: cast indignation
 
This spell fills the members of the caster's group with the Fury of
The High Gods, causing them to fight more effectively.  INDIGNATION
improves not only the likelihood of hitting targets, but the damage
done when a hit is made.  
 
The Fury of The High Gods is an enormous burden to carry, hence the
spells duration is relatively brief.

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
&w
Syntax:  c infravision
Syntax:  c infravision <character>
 
This spell enables the character to detect the heat signatures of other
players and creatures in the room with them.  This spell will also allow
you to find items in corpses, containers, etc. but will not allow you to
view the actual contents.
 
You must have a light source to actually see items, room descriptions,
the contents of corpses or containers, room exits and the like inside
a darkened area.
 
Infravision is not the same as "night vision".
~

0 'INNER WARMTH' INNER WARMTH~
&w
This spell makes you more resistant to all forms of coldness.
~

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

54 INSTAROOM~
&w
Syntax: instaroom
 
This command will set the resets for the room you are in to the
exact parameters which are in the room. Be sure not to leave odd
objects, such as spilled blood, corpses, or remnants on the ground
at the time when you perform an instaroom.
 
See also: RESET, RESETCMDS and INSTAZONE.
 
~

61 INSTAZONE~
&w
Syntax: instazone [nodoors]

This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area. All you
have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it should be
wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their proper
places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper states,
(open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your current
resets (if any), and create new ones for you. You may optionally specify
"nodoors" so that door resets will not be created.
 
NOTE: This command will wipe out any existing resets! Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
 
~

0 INT INTELLIGENCE~
&w
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:

 - hit points gained per level for Enchanters and Scholars.
 
 - mana/energy gained per level for Bards.
 
 - affects learning between combatants.
 
~

0 INTERMUD3~
&w
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently there is no way
for public or private traffic to be passed from one network to
the other.

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~

~

64 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>
 
This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.

death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being
killed by mortals, or &RDeadlies &Wkilling fellow clanmembers will result
in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &PKiller &Wflag if:
 
  1. You caused the DEATH of another player, regardless of who attacked first.
  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &PKiller &Wflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a

jail, or SLAYED by Harakiem.  You may apply to Judge Kendra in person to
seek removal of the flag. She is located one west of the Main Lobby in

~

0 LANCER~
&w
LANCER

This is a class of warrior much in the same vein as Chevaliers, who uphold
a high personal code of honor and travel the world to protect those in 
need. They are of the races which cannot ride mounts, and thus are unable 
to develop the same sort of fighting style as that used by a Chevalier. 
Some take advantage of their ability to BE mounted to mimic the style used 
by their counterparts, while othersneither able to ride a mount to battle 
nor to provide service as onehave developed a style that heavily employs 
their speed and strength in combination with spears and similar weapons to 
strike enemies from further away, harder.

One who is unmountable and does not possess hooves is not capable of 
becoming a Lancer due to the physical requirements of this style of life, 
but might be better suited to being a Chevalier.

&w
LANDWALK REVERT
 
Syntax: landwalk
Syntax: Revert

understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

58 LAST~

-1 'LAW ASSIST'~
&w
&GA non-deadly may give, sell or trade scrolls, potions and equipment
with a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly character may spy for a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly may _not_ shield, heal, summon, help, hinder, portal or
otherwise assist a deadly character (this includes charm).
 
~

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
&w
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.
 
Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
 
If any level of Immortal asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  An Immortal's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.
 
&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
&w
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Darkhaven, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
&w
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal or drop and sacrifice the item.
 
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
&w
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

-1 'LAW KILLSTEAL'~
&w
Don't do it...
 
Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought.  This is both highly annoying and illegal.  If someone should do
this to you please inform them of the rules (ask them to read 'laws
killsteal').  If they continue, seek an immortal but do not take the law
into your own hands.
 
~

-1 LAW LAWS~
&w
&GThe Realms are governed by a set of laws, most of which are simple common
sense and courtesy, and all of which must be followed to ensure everyone
the opportunity to enjoy the game.  As with any mud, a player's presence
here is a priviledge, not a right, and is something we reserve the right
to deny at any time at our discretion.
 
The Immortals of the Realms are responsible for enforcing these laws, and
their decisions these matters should be abided.  If you feel an Immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may petition directly to a level 56 (God)
or higher or you may petition via a note at the Oracle.
 
The decisions of a God or higher are final.  To see which Immortals are
online and visible, type "who 51" at any time.
 
To read the laws, type "laws <topic>" for any of the following:
&W 
       |  CHANNELS      |  PKILL     |  STORES  |  HARASSMENT  |
       |  MULTIPLAYING  |  SHARING   |  STAKE   |  CHARM       |
       |  OBJECTS       |  CHEATING  |  MURDER  |  ASSIST      |
 
&GFor further explanation, see section 2 of the Adventurer's Guide...
~

-1 'LAW MULTIPLAYING'~
&w
&GMulti-playing is permitted within the Realms, with the following rules:
 
 - you may only have &Wone&G character link-live if it is a deadly character
   (if it appears under the "who deadly" section of the who list).  You may
   have more than one character online as long as &Wnone&G of your characters
   are listed under the "who deadly" section of the who list.
 
 - using multiple characters to spam any player or channel via making all
   characters say/tell/chat/avtalk a same message or series of messages
   is highly frowned upon and may earn each character a silence.
 
&WNOTE:&G  Link-dead characters are not considered to be "online."
 
~

-1 'LAW MURDER'~
&w
&GPlayer killing is decided the instant you cast any hostile spell or make
any aggressive action against a non-deadly player.  Actually killing the
target means little.  The only form of player killing allowed is between
players whose names appear on "who deadly" section of the who list.  A
battle between non-deadly characters is still illegal even if those who
are involved have agreed to the combat.
 
Being involved in an illegal pkill is a serious violation of law, and can
result in a stay in hell, slay, loss of all equipment, freeze and/or deny
or site ban. 
 
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
&w
&GIf you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present.
 
Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.
 
Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
 
Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing gold from a corpse.
 
* &WWarning:&G  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.
 
~

-1 'LAW PKILL'~
&w
&GDeadly Characters are those which appear on the who list under the section
titled "Deadly Characters" (type 'who deadly').  A character must be level
5 _and_ 18 years of age to officially become deadly; if you are a pkill
character who doesn't fill these criteria yet, you will not appear under
'who deadly' and are _not_ yet able to pkill.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 
Deadly characters are allowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or delt the killing blow.
 c) use mobs within or lower than the pkill level range of the victim
 
&WWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.
 
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
&w
&GCharacter sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  Immortals will &Wnot&G recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.
 
A character may &Wnot&G be shared if:
 - the character is a deadly character
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order
 
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
&w
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
 
~

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
&w
&GThe first player to attack a mob has the rights to the kill.  Others should
not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are 
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.
 
Any disputes brought to the attention of an immortal for resolution will be
handled according the the immortal's discretion.  All such decisions are final.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
&w
&GShopkeepers inside Darkhaven are protected by the laws of the city's Lord,
Duke Luther.  As the gods have pledged their favor to Darkhaven, they have
imbued these shopkeepers with the powers necessary to carry out retribution
against those who defy these laws.  In short, anyone who chooses to attack
a Darkhaven shopkeeper will die brutally.  In addition, they may find
themselves facing the direct wrath of the gods in hell...
 
Those caught stealing from these shopkeepers will be incarcerated by the
guards of the Duke until such time as their release is granted by the gods.
 
A Darkhaven shopkeeper is any mob inside Darkhaven at which you can type
'list'.  If you are given a list of items for sale, or are told to try
back later, it is a shopkeeper.  This also applies to guild shopkeepers
and the blacksmith.
 
~

52 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

LIZARDFOLK

A tribal people of Lavada, the lizardfolk have historically preferred to 
limit their contact with the outside world to the port towns in northern 
Lavada and to trade with the Benn. In the modern day, a strange prophet 
has ascended to power among them, and commands them now to go out into 
the world in search of a strange artifact called "Adrin".

Lizardfolk are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard               Cleric   Druid   Elementalist  Enchanter  Illusionist

64 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

1 MAGIC_MISSILE~
&w
Syntax: Cast Magic <mob>
 
Magic Missile  enables the caster to hit a victim with a blast of magic from a
distance. In order to work, the conditions must be right and the victim must be
visible to the caster. Attempting to hit a player with a missile will cause
the caster to be branded an Attacker. 
Ex: If an orc were one room to the west, you could hit the orc by typing
cast magic orc .
~

1 'MAGNETIC THRUST'~
&w
'Magnetic Thrust,' much like 'Sonic Resonance,' allows the casting
Mage to control the nature of space and time in the immediate locale
of his victim.  In this sorcery, the Mage forms a wedge of magnetic
energy within the body of the victim.  As the spell progresses, the
victims organs are violently rent and internal tissues are torn.  The
resulting pain and damage are formidible, indeed.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
&w
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

1 MISSILE~
&w
Missile weapons have the unique ability to fire at one's opponent
from a distance.  In order to be successful, the attacker must have a 
weapon missile wielded (Only certain weapons are able to be missile wielded)
and must have an appropriate ammunition in inventory.

Example: To use a bow and arrow, one must have a bow missile wielded and
have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch
~

53 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

&WDISCLAIMER: &RBefore reading this, understand that the formulas contained
&Rherein are based on the distribution SMAUG 1.4a. Any changes made since
that
&Rpoint will not be reflected in any way.
&G
I am going to attempt to unfold the mystery that surrounds the topic of mob
creation that is called experience. You may want to have a calculator
handy.
This is no topic for the novice builder, but it is one that must be learned
in
the long run in order to create and publish professional and usable worlds
in
the SMAUG code base.
 
&WRule #1 &G- Building an area is not a recreational sport. If you have never
been a dungeon master in a table top role play game, consider this: most
DM's
take MANY, many hours contemplating one evening of role play. How every
crea-
ture they've created, every house, building, tower and animal is going to
react
to the players sitting around the table. When you create an area for an
online
game, your biggest chore will be putting YOU inside the mobs/rooms/objects
FOREVER.  YOU have to be able to run the area every time a new player goes
through it. YOU have to design for every mentality, and every possible
combin-
ation of ideas that a player on the other side of a fiber optic line will
come
up with. The worst part, is you can't be there the first time a player goes
through. If you are building a fluff area that won't have a major theme,
then
you can skip some steps. However, EXPERIENCE and MOB CREATION are not steps
you
can skip without warping the leveling system.
 
&WRule #2&G - Leveling was NOT meant to be easy. Like it or not, regardless of
what MUD you come from, the code appears to be designed around the same
con-
cepts of the old days of role play, where only a FEW make it to the top.
Any
alteration to this ideal will lead to challenging problems in the areas of
leveling and building.

&WRule #3&G - All of the stats a mob is allowed to be given, are supposed to be
used. While some stats will be defaulted by the code, most will be
considered
as ZERO's when that mob is put to use. Those that are defaulted by the code
are
generally better just counted as zeros anyway, because that's what they'll
do
for your experience situations, ZERO.

53 MOBCREATE2~
&GOk then.  Ready for the magic number?? Ready for the big kahuna?!
 
&Y(level*level*level*5) + maxhitpoints
-((ac-50)*2)+(((damnum*damsize)+damroll)
&Y*50) + (Hitroll*level*10)
&G
What does this all mean? You really don't wanna know. Besides, given a
calcu-
lator and some time, anyone can do the math. What's important is this: out
of
that formula, what parts of your mob most affect a mobs experience worth.
&G
Before any of this matters, you need to know what your maximum and minimum
amounts of experience allowable are, as coded in your mud. Distribution
SMAUG
1.4a was a minimum of 20, and maximum of 500k. So lets break down the
exper-
ience formula a bit.
&G
Let us look at an example mobs stats that pertain to the above:
&R
Level: 25            Maxhitpoints : 2000          Armorclass: -190
Damdie: 4d4+30       Damroll: 30                  Hitroll: 9
&G
The formula adds up like so :
&C
           Level*Level*Level*5 =     78125
                 +Maxhitpoints =    + 2000
                 - ((ac-50)*2) =    - -480 (or +480)
+((damnum*damsize+damroll)*50) =    + 2300
           +(Hitroll*level*10) =    + 2250
           -------------------      ------
                BASE EXP WORTH       85155
&G
What does this number mean? Nothing, on its own. WHAT?! All that math for a
meaningless number? Well, yes. And no.  This number is going to get changed
A LOT from here to the end of the math. So follow me slowly.
&G
Next, we need to check if the mob is affected by sanctuary, shockshield or
fireshield.  Why these three?  Because it's coded that way. A mob that is
affected by sanctuary has its total exp worth increased by 1.5 times. A mob
that is affected by shockshield or fireshield has it increased by 1.2
times.
&W
SEE NEXT: MOBCREATE3
 
~

53 MOBCREATE3~
&GSo we add this to the formula. For our example, the mob will have all three
affect types on.

               AFF SHOCKSHIELD     +562022
               ---------------------------
               TOTAL EXP WORTH     1030374
&G
But as we stated above, the total experience a mob can be worth is limited
by
a hard code to 500k xp. So we will use 500000 as our magic number from here
on
out. We'll place an example or two for lower levels along the way. (Notice
also
that the mob used in this example is Level 25, yet still more than maxes
out
the experience system of a distribution SMAUG mud.)
&G
From here, we have to move into combat and find out just how it is that a
PC
will reap the benefits of our beautifully created mobile.
 
        &WEXAMPLE:&R Using the above mob we add -
        &RLevel 22 Warrior with an alignment of 1000
        &RThe mobile has an alignment of -1000
        &RThe warrior does 100 hitpoints of damage in ONE ROUND.
&G
For even just as simple a thing as a single hit, the code tosses some more
calculations and formulas into the mix.
&G
First the mud considers the level difference between PC and mobile. To a
certain extent, the number of levels a PC is lower than a mobile, the mud
increases the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G of the mob.
&G
Next, we consider alignments. If a PC is 1000+ points differnt than the mob
in
alignment, the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G is multiplied times 1.25. However, if a GOOD
aligned PC attacks a GOOD aligned mobile, the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G is multiplied
by 0.75.
&G
Next we randomize life, as it should be and spit out a value from 3/4 times
the
TOTAL EXP WORTH to 1 1/4 times the TOTAL EXP WORTH for the USABLE EXP.
 
&WSEE NEXT: MOBCREATE4
 
~

53 MOBCREATE4~
53 MOBCREATE4&G
Back to our example, our mob had 2000 max hp. 200 damage done is 5%. The
mud
now spits back out 5% of USABLE EXP and multiplies it times 0.85. This is
the
amount of experience a character receives when he hits our mob for 200
hitpoint
damage.
&G
The math explained :
&C
      Level Difference (3)        =   650000 (TOTAL EXP WORTH * 1.3)
     *Alignment Difference (2000) =   * 1.25
      ---------------------------     ------
      SUBTOTAL                    =   812500
      USABLE EXP                  =   Between 609375 and 1015625
  (No modifier for good attacking
   good gets used in this example)
      Damage to Mob (5%)*.85      =   Between 25898 and 43163
                                           THIS IS _ONE_ ROUND!
&G
What things can you do to decrease this value? The easiest, quickest,
simplest
ways to defeat this problem are.....
&W       A. Increase Max Hitpoints (decrease percentage from damage)
&W       B. Decrease Level (Quickest way to reduce the TOTAL EXP WORTH)
&G
The above formulas are applied to EVERY type of damage, except for CIRCLE
and
BACKSTAB, which yield NO Experience. This was done so that the experience
system and damage systems could be left relatively safe, while still
keeping
the powerful skills in place.
&W
IN CONCLUSION.. &GWhat are the things you are considering when you build a
mob?
First, only make the mob as high a level as its hit points and damage
returned
rate. My general rule of thumb starts with NO LESS than 100 hitpoints PER
LEVEL of mob. A 100 hitpoints/level mob is a decent leveling mob in most
in-
stances. Any less than this, you have a powerleveling mob. Think about the
level of characters intended to be in your area attacking your mobiles.
Then go
find out what their average stats are. Pay particular attention to Hitroll,
Average damage (which means damroll as well as average weapon damage),
armor
class, alignment and avg max hitpoints.

MONK

While not every person who chooses to live in the relative wilderness is of 
this particular discipline, many are. Monks focus on the development of the 
self outside of a societal model, and are often great philosophists and 
scholars. They seek self-improvement through the development of the self as 
a weapon. Monks may wear small aides to the weapons of their fists, but 
generally do not add more than the barest amount to these already deadly 
weapons. They are very skilled in wilderness survival areas, though they 
tend not to have much in the way of knowledge about larger society.

1 MOVE MOVEMENT~
&w
This discusses the process of moving your character from one place in the
Realms to another.  The common movements are north, east, south, west, up
down, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  You may also move
in these directions by the use of n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, and nw.
If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.
 
At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP.  When are finished with
your recovery, and wish to continue adventuring, type WAKE or STAND.
 
For more detailed information on movement and doors, read sections 7 and
8 of your Adventurer's Guide book.

~

52 MPDEPOSIT MPWITHDRAW~
Syntax:  mpdeposit <amount>
Syntax:  mpwithdraw <amount>
 
This command orders the mobile to deposit or withdraw a specified number
of gold coins from an area.  These can be used in conjunction with mpat
to tell the mob which area to withdraw/deposit money in.
 
Example:  mpat 21000 mpwithdraw 5000000
 
This would cause the mob to withdraw 5 million coins from the new Darkhaven
area, as that is the area vnum 21000 is in.
 
If no mpat is used, the mob will withdraw or deposit the gold from the
area in which it is located at the time.

~

54 MPFLAG MPRMFLAG~
&w
Syntax:  mpflag      <victim> <flag> <value>
         mprmflag    <victim> <flag> <value>
 
Using these commands you can assign variables based on 128 "bits". These
bits work like On/Off switches and may be assigned by any mob. A typical
mpflag will look like :
 
                      testing:3=[1]
 
testing is the name of the flag, 3 is the vnum of the mob that assigned the
flag, and the "[1]" is the bit that is enabled. When more than one bit is
enabled, it will look more like:
 
                testing:3=[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
 
In this case, bits 1 and 11 are enabled, 2-10 are disabled. To make use of
these flags, use the "isflagged" ifchecks. Mpflags will be assigned to a
player for a mobs "level X intelligence". The flag will save when the 
character saves and will continue to exist for the amount of time 
"mudtime". You can also set the timer for a tag using the commands 
"noexpire" or "timer".
 
Eg.    mpflag noexpire $n <flag> [value]
       mpflag timer <#> $n <flag> [value]
 
If no timer is designated, the timer is set based on the mobs intelligence
multiplied by the mobs level.

~

52 MPINVIS~
Syntax:  mpinvis
Syntax:  mpinvis <level>
 
This command controls a mob's ability to use a modified form of wizinvis.
 
Use 'mpinvis' alone to toggle the invisibility.
 
Use 'mpinvis <level>' to set the level at which the mob will be invis.
 
Mortals under the mobinvis level of the mob will be unable to see the mob
when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any spell, it will be
completely invisible to them.
 
Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo
that they see, just as if a wizinvis immortal performed the action.
 
Also be warned that at the present time, area attacks _will_ hit a mobinvis
creature even if it is invisible.

64 MPSSET~
&w
Syntax: mpsset $n <skillname> <1-100>

~

54 MPTAG MPRMTAG~
&w
Syntax:  mptag      <victim> <tag> [value]
         mprmtag    <victim> <tag>
 
Using these commands, you can assign a "tag", or "variable" to a character,
either just the tag, or the tag and a value associated with it.
 
The tag can be both a string variable (a group of characters, or words) or
an "integer" variable, a number. If using a number you can use the ifcheck
"istagged" to compare how big or little the number is using <>= operators.
 
The tag assigned to a character will last on the character based on the
mob's intelligence and level that assigned it. ( eg INT x LEVEL ) So a
level 10 mob with an intelligence of 13 will tag for a length of 130 ticks.
These tags will save to a characters pfile and will last over logging out 
and logging in. You can also set the timer for a tag using the commands 
"noexpire" or "timer".
 
Eg.    mptag noexpire $n <tag> [value]
       mptag timer <#> $n <tag> [value]
 
You can additionally specify a vnum to be associated with a particular tag.
Tagging a mob with the 0 vnum allows all mobs to see/modify that tag.

Eg.    mptag $n <tag>:<vnum> [value]
       mptag $n <tag>:0      [value]

Mprmtag can also be used to clear all bits of a particular mpflag. See
mpflag for more information.

MSET sets the properties of mobiles. If a mobile has the PROTOTYPE flag, 
modifying an instance of this mobile will also modify the index mobile, which 
all other instances of the mobile are based on.
 
MSET ON will lock you onto a particular mob/character. Once locked on, all
mset commands will imply 'mset <character>'. Hitting enter while in MSET ON
will give you an mstat of the mob/character you are working on. To get out
of MSET ON, simply type the word DONE. Example:
 
        mset gracca on
        long A large hulking figure stands here.
        sex 1
        done

head...

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

those forms of communication.
 
Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence.  Simple use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

54 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6 
Continued in help 'NUISANCE STAGES2'
~

54 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.
Soon there will be more options, when they come in the help files you should

51 NUISANCE UNNUISANCE~
&WSyntax:
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.

53 OPSTAT~
Syntax: opstat <object/object vnum>
 
Opstat will display all of the objprograms that have been written for the
specified object.  If a copy of the object exists in the game, it can be
accessed by its vnum.
 
See OPEDIT, TRIGGER, OPTRIGGERS, OPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2 VARIABLES
~

0 ORDER~
&w
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

1 ORDERS~
&w
Syntax:  orders
    or:  orders <order name>
 
This command will display a list of all currently existing Orders, as
well as their deities, leaders, mobkills and mobdeaths.
 
You can also use 'orders <order name>' to view information on the
specified Order.
 
See also GUILDS, ORDERS
 
~

0 ORDERTALK OT~
&w
Syntax:  ordertalk <message>
 
Provided that you are in an Order, ordertalk will send the message to
all members currently online, as well as the deity if they are online.
~

51 OSET MPOSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

PALADIN

Like Clerics, Paladins are generally sworn to a deitys service. They are 
not the sort to travel as easily, tending to remain in service of a 
specific structure devoted to the worship of said deity. Versed in basic 
healing magics, reading and writing in whatever language is native to them 
and the magic of creating food, Paladins are taught the use of arms to 
prepare them in case attacks ever come upon those they are sworn to 
protect. It is not a style of finesse, so much as force to try to finish 
things quickly and to keep the need for such things to a minimum.

0 'PASS DOOR'~

~

0 PASSWORD~
&w
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.

2 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
&w
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

be used before the background color. Also, the last color setting in your
prompt will wash over into the text you type. So, if you want a set
of colors for your typed text, include that at the end of your prompt set.

Prompt &&Y^^b<%h/&&x^^r%m>&&w^^x = <43/23>
        {A}     {B}       {C}

1 POSSESS~
&w
Syntax: cast possess <mob>
 
This spell enables you to switch into a mob for a short amount of time.
The spell has the same general restrictions as charming, but costs
much more mana. You will be able to perform many skills/spells that the
mob you have possessed is able to perform, for only as long as you
are the possessor. When you die, you will return to your body.
 
For the duration of your possession of a mobile, you will also be
in possession of its hitpoints, mana, movement, and equipment,
rather than your own. You will also find that exits will not
appear to you automatically, and your scoresheet will be different.
To see exits while you are possessing, simply type "exits" manually.
 
Lastly, keep in mind that mobiles are treated differently from
players in many respects. You may find that you cannot enter some
rooms, or that certain mobiles will behave towards you aggressively,
Luckily, your "human shell" will be unaffected by events which
happen to your possessed mobs, and you can always return.
 
** You must have the heart of a mob in your possession for this spell to 
   work. **

missile'. This will place the bow, sling or other firing mechanism
in the location 'missile wielded', which you will see when you type 'eq'.
 
You must have a type of projectile in your inventory, this being an arrow,
rock, bolt, pebble or other projectile(s).

mechanism. If you do not practice it, you will not be able to fire.
 
Lastly, provided you have a projectile in inventory, and a firing
weapon wielded in the 'missile wielded' position, you are ready to
try out your new projectile.

attempt, which can have severe consequences. If you and your mortal

1 'QUANTUM SPIKE'~
&w
The 'Quantum Spike' is one of the Sorceror's most awesome attacks.  With
this spell, the casting Mage is able to form, within the body of his
victim, a sphere of Quantum probability optimized in such a way as to
cause the most bizarre contortion of bodily order imaginable.  Organs
and tissues are rendered into unrecognizable blobs interconnected in
fiendish, unknowable geometries.
 
Obviously, such an attack has astonishing effects on any physical
creature, as well as any entity which has an extention into the
physical world.

Syntax: QUEST <message>

The quest channel is one which is typically used when a quest is being 
run, to notify players who are involved as to new updates.
 
Quests are held at the whim of Immortals. If you are using the Quest channel
to ask if there is a quest, you are probably too late to enter. Simply keep
the channel on and wait for an Immortal's announcement, should there be one.

1 QUESTS QUESTING~
&w
  Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms.  They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Realms.  Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throught the realm.
  Different quests will result in different awards.  Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.
 
Some things to remember while questing:
 
 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of 
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum - in the Hall of Heroes located
    in the Darkhaven Town Hall.
 
 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you.  If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.
 
 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most 
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved

1 QUIT QUI~
&w
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

RANGER

Rangers are gifted with a unique ability to bridge the gap between the 
extreme wilderness that appeals so to Druids, Elementalists and Monks, 
while never fully treading as a part of what is referred to by those 
within it as civilization. They are not magically trained but have no 
need to be, as they are diversely skilled by right of their preferred 
lifestyle. Rangers often travel, and love to explore.

old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.

1 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
&w
Deadly characters are never eligible for Reimbursements.
Experience can _not_ be reimbursed under any circumstances whatsoever.

The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost due to carrying items above your level.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.

To apply for a reimbursement post a note on the Oracle Board setting out the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
Demi God or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal may deny
one.  We will attempt to deal with the request as expeditiously as possible.
~

1 REKEY~
&w
Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.
 
Rekey is included in the rename fee. See help glory for more information.
~

1 REMAINS~
&w
Syntax:  remains
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.

0 'REMOVE BLINDNESS'~
&w
Syntax: cast 'remove blindness' <character>

This spell cures blindness in one so unfortunate.

Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

This spell removes a curse from a character, or one of the objects a
character is carrying or using.
~

0 'REMOVE TRAP'~
&w
Syntax: cast 'remove trap' <object>

This spell will magically disarm a trap on an object.
~

1 RENAME~
&w
A rename may be done by a level 54 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 56 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

1 RENT~
&w
Syntax: RENT ... characters never have to rent!
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave

~

54 RENUMBER~
&YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &rcheck the
code&w if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &rlimbo.are,
newdark.are, newacad.are&w.

1 REPAIR~
&w
Syntax:   repair <object>
          repair all
 
Repair allows you to repair equipment and swords at metal blacksmiths,
and recharge staves and wands at magical 'blacksmiths.'  Repair all
attempts to repair every item in your inventory.
 
There is a 10% surcharge for using "repair all". This surcharge is for
the convenience of having all the equipment in your inventory repaired
at once.

53 REPAIRSET~
Syntax:  repairset <mobile vnum> <field> <value>

51 REPEAT~
Syntax: repeat <letter>
 
This command will repeat tell messages which you
have already received. If no parameters are given
it will simply produce the last tell you received.
If a single letter is given, then the last tell
sent to you by a character with a name starting
with that letter will be displayed. This is an imm
only command.
~

1 REPOP~
&w
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

and the current local time for the host computer.
 
WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~

51 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

WARNING:
  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip

~

0 ROGUE~
&w
ROGUE

Not all Rogues are versed in the dark arts of deception, but it is
typically  associated with persons of their persuasion. Generally trained
in the use of  light, concealable and ranged weapons, rogues aim to make
certain that combat  will never distract them from their other business
for long. Their style is to be quick and deadly, more for their own
benefit than those they come up  against. Not all rogues are wholly
reliant upon physical weapons, but not many tend toward magical studies.
Those that do usually are more interested in the  use of already existing
magical items or base magical potions to further their  ends. A subtle
weapon is an effective one. They therefore often learn the  magical ritual
for detecting and examining magical influences, and are also  usually
skilled at herbcraft, forgery, medicine and law. One must know what  is
legal to the letter if one wishes to protect ones innocence when it is, 
invariably, questioned. Not all rogues are of the light build so commonly 
associated to the stereotype, but very few rogues choose to wear armor
more  obvious in its nature than leather.

RULES
 
The rules of Njata:

1) Use in character channels like Say and Whisper for in
   character communication, and out of character channels
   like Tell, Ask, Answer and Chat for out of character
   conversations. When in doubt, ask an Immortal!

2) You are responsible for anything your character does.  
   The excuse "But someone else was playing my character
   is not an acceptable one.

3) No botting whatsoever. In addition to violating any
   of our attempts here at immersion, this also leads to
   griefing other people who are actually -playing- their
   character.

4) Multiplying is allowed, but only so long as your
   characters aren't PVP flagged. Exceptions will be made
   for multiple players playing on the same LAN, of course.
   
5) Don't advertise other muds or post offensive links in 
   public areas. If you're unsure about what's offensive,
   don't post it!

6) Please don't harass others. We have a zero tolerance
   policy for griefers, and will come down hard on anyone 
   doing it to others.

Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves approximately one character
every minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

~

1 SAVE POSITIONS~

physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
Dead          Mortally Wounded        Incapacitated
Stunned       Sleeping                Fighting (Berserk)

0 SCHOLAR~
&w
SCHOLAR

Scholars are those who study magic entirely through the use of books. There
 are many types of magic to study, and most Scholars use only one or maybe
two.  Though they cannot use their books to learn of enchanting (which
comes  naturally), illusion magic (which requires a different kind of
study entirely)  or elemental magic (which is taught without written
material), Scholars are  able to tap into what is thought of as ancient
magic, once practiced  throughout Njata by Scholars of great power.
Through the gathering of  spellbooks, scrolls, and runed objects to learn
their spells, Scholars are  able to recreate long-forgotten magics to
great effect. These magics are very  difficult to find, and even moreso to
learn. Though there are few spells among  them, Scholars find this magic
to be one of the most rewarding and versatile  kinds.

1 'SECOND ATTACK' 'THIRD ATTACK' 'FOURTH ATTACK' 'FIFTH ATTACK'~
&w
These are powerful skills which allow a character to attack more than
once per combat round. Use of these skills is automatic once you have
practiced them.
 
While you can practice the attacks out of turn (third attack before you
have mastered second attack, for example), it is extremely inefficient
to do so.
 
When you first learn the skills, your additional attacks will be quite
unthreatening, but as you advance the skill through the ranks, the damage of
your additional attacks will increase up to a limit based on whether the extra
attack is a second, third, fourth or fifth attack.

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

Notes on the planned Njata Skill/Spell system:

Chieftain, here is where we currently sit. Skills will need to be learned
from teachers, but will probably be visible on the slist. Most spells are
inherent, much like a 3.x sorcerer, and characters will learn these
automatically as they level up. These might be secret(hidden from the from
the slist) unsure yet. Scholars learn from exploration. I'm currently
toying with the idea of making all their abilities secret and available
from level 1 on. If I want to limit them by level, the level of their
study skill would be the logical choice.

1 'SOLAR FLIGHT'~
&w
Syntax:  c 'solar flight' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to merge from an outdoor area to their victim
in an outdoor area.
 
The spell has a few restrictions:  you will only succeed in casting it
during daytime hours, between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. and you will only succeed
in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need
the power of the sun in order for this spell to work (thus it will also
not succeed in bad weather).

1 SPAM~
&w
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.

1 SPEAK LANGUAGE~

1 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
&w
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.

0 TELEPORT~
&w
&YSyntax&W: c teleport

This spell takes you from your current location to a random location somewhere
in the world.  As the energies involved are difficult to control, there is no
sure way of determining your destination.  Therefore, caution and planning
should be in the forefront when considering whether to use this spell.

56 THINK~
There is *no* "la la la"ing on think.
~

0 TICK~
&w
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

01 to 06                "is in the last stages of decay."
 
Since a corpse now lasts from 40 to 60 minutes, we are requested to wait
until the corpse has reached below a timer of 23 or has hit the
"fills the air with a foul stench." stage in decay.
 
You can see what stage of decay a corpse is in by either typing:
ostat <player name>       (i.e. ostat Brittany)    OR
at 'corpse <name>' look   (i.e. at 'corpse Brittany' look)

53 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.

object.

~

57 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  cast 'true sight'
 
This spell can only be cast upon yourself.  It is a combination of
infravision (enabling you to see in the dark), detect invisible,
and detect hidden.  This spell also allows you to see through
blinding attacks.
~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
&w
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

0 TUMBLE~
&w
Syntax:  operates independently
 
Tumble is a high-level thief skill for the evasion of incoming attacks.
The skill functions autonomically, and its effectiveness is greater for
more dexterous thieves.
 
~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>

NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.
 
~

0 UNICORN UNICORNS~
&w
UNICORN

Magically inclined pursuers of knowledge, unicorns are particularly fond of 
young creatures and are known to usually protect them from harm. Many races 
think of them as heroic, though unicorns are no more exempt from fault than 
any other. They are particularly well-suited to travel, since they have
great endurance.

Unicorns are able to become the following classes:
 
Bard                        Druid   Elementalist  Enchanter  Illusionist 
Lancer  Monk       Paladin          Rogue         Scholar    Warrior
 
~

1 'UNRAVEL DEFENSE'~
&w
Syntax: c 'unravel defense' <victim>
 
This spell renders the victim susceptible to both magic and nonmagic attacks.
~

1 UPLIFT~
&w
Syntax:  c uplift <target>
 
Uplift is a cleric spell that can heal from afar, meant to be used in 
aiding players with negative hitpoints.
Uplift is not to be used as your common mode of healing.  Repeatedly asking
for uplifts on public channels is spammy and annoying for other players.  
Keep in mind that the clerics that are uplifting you are doing so out of 
kindness.  Do _not_ abuse it or consider it a right.
~

1 UPPERCUT~
&w
Syntax:  uppercut
 
Uppercut is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started,
and can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

54 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
&w
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or

your message.

voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
&w
WARRIOR

Warriors are able to become acquainted with just about any kind of weapon. 
They favor heavy arms and melee in many cases, but are able to use ranged,
small and exotic weapons should they choose to specialize in them. A 
consequence of such intensive weapons training is a lack of magical 
learning, but warriors are generally those who found no interest in such
studies. They are predisposed to numerous skills beyond those basic to the
art of fighting, and are generally quite capable at tracking, cooking, 
clothmending and bartering. Some warriors also endeavor to become skilled
in metalworking or leatheworking to allow themselves to repair and even
create  their own weapons and armor. Warriors come in all shapes and
sizes, but due  to their intensive physical orientation in their everyday
lives, most warriors are capable of wearing even the heaviest of armors if
it will benefit them.

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

1 WEAPONS~
&w
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.
~

51 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

51 WULFENGUIDE WULFENSGUIDE WULFEN~
WULFENS GUIDE
 
Hello! Many of you know me as Wulfen, the Builder, which is exactly what
I am here on Njata! I've been working on a guide for builders on how
to write awesome room descriptions all week, so here it is!
 
The Art of Room Describing:
Yes, there is an art to room describing, an art in which I am willing to
share my knowledge of. What I like to do is close my eyes, and imagine
I'm walking around in the area I'm describing, after maybe 2 minutes of
imagining that, I remind myself of the rules of writing descriptions, then
I get going on the description.
 
What to Put in the Room Description:
I almost always put at least 3 specific elements into a room description.
The first is what you can see in the direct vicinity around you. The second
is what you can hear/smell around you. And the third, which a lot of people
leave out, but I find is an excellent filler, is what is in the rooms
around adjacent to you. Also, I make it a rule of thumb to have at least 4
lines in my room descriptions.
 
The Rules of Describing Rooms:
The generally accepted rules of room describing are as follows. First,
NEVER USE THE WORD YOU! Never ever ever. Never never...ever ever...never
ever...NEVER! There IS a good reason why this is the base rule of room
describing. If you are going to use the word you, then you're almost always
going to force something on the player. An example I see a lot is..."You
walk into the room.". That's a huge no-no. Bad room describer...BAD! *Hits
you with a rolled up newspaper on the nose* What if they're flying? What
if they're snake-people and they slither? What if they got shot out of a
cannon into the room?! As a basic rule, I never use the word "you" when
describing rooms. Rule #2- ALWAYS FOLLOW RULE #1! Rule 3, never put weather
patterns in your room descriptions. I can only think of one exception to
this rule, but we don't have that feature on this mud, so you don't need to
worry about it. Rule 4, SPELLCHECK. Run it through a spellchecker, it's
really easy, I can give you a site that will spellcheck, you can open
almost any version of Microsoft Word and it will spellcheck excellently.
I think even Zmud will spellcheck for you. If you don't spellcheck, you
better be a prodigy at spelling and grammar and punctuation, because if
players see words spelled wrong, especially when they see words spelled
wrong, they will question how hard we really worked on the mud. I know we
busted our asses through the creation process, but they don't, for all they
know, we could have ripped areas from another mud. So remember, always
spellcheck descs!

-WulfenPS- Oh yeah, and unless you have a very good reason not, you should
always format your descriptions to make them look pretty. /f for that!

~

52 ZONES~
Syntax: zones [low] [high]

Lists the name of the file, and room/mob/object vnum range for each
non-prototype zone in the mud.

-1 _DIEMSG_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
more free than you have ever felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
